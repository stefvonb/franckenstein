# Franckenstein

## Introduction
If you are reading this, you either want to explore some code which uses python to interpret data from a serial port (such as an Arduino) to make plots or you are a poor postgraduate student who got picked by Prof. Haddad to run the Franck-Hertz experiment for the second years. In either case, you might want to know a bit about how the code works.

As I vaguely mentioned above, this project was designed to read in inputs for a typical *Franck-Hertz* experiment (a small introduction to which can be seen [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franckâ€“Hertz_experiment)). While the physics related to this experiment is incredibly interesting (and Nobel prize winning btw) this readme will focus on the technical aspects needed to convert signals into plots.
